# AI Prompting Mastery Checklist - TrainingSites Method

## Getting Started with Effective AI Prompts

### âœ“ Foundation Setup
- [ ] Understand your goal before writing any prompt
- [ ] Start with simple, clear language (avoid jargon)
- [ ] Practice with basic prompts before advancing

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:** The best prompts are conversations, not commands. Think about how you'd explain your need to a helpful colleague.

### âœ“ Prompt Structure Basics
- [ ] Begin with context about your situation
- [ ] Clearly state what you want the AI to do
- [ ] Specify the format you need (list, paragraph, steps, etc.)
- [ ] Include any constraints or requirements

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:** Use "Act as a [role]" to give Claude helpful context about the perspective you need.

### âœ“ Making Prompts More Effective
- [ ] Be specific about length (short email, 3-paragraph summary, etc.)
- [ ] Include examples when possible ("like this, but for...")
- [ ] Ask for explanations when learning ("explain why you chose this approach")
- [ ] Use follow-up questions to refine results

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:** If your first result isn't quite right, ask Claude to adjust specific parts rather than starting over.

### âœ“ Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid
- [ ] Don't use overly complex or technical language
- [ ] Avoid vague requests like "make this better"
- [ ] Don't assume the AI knows unstated context
- [ ] Never skip proofreading AI-generated content

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:** The more context you provide, the better your results will be. Think of it as briefing a new team member.

### âœ“ Practice and Improvement
- [ ] Try the same prompt with small variations to see differences
- [ ] Save prompts that work well for future use
- [ ] Build a collection of "starter prompts" for common tasks
- [ ] Practice regularly with different types of content

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:** Keep a "prompt journal" to track what works best for different types of tasks you do regularly.
